If you want to keep developing your Flaskr project, here are some ideas for what to try next:

- [x] A detail view to show a single post. Click a postâ€™s title to go to its page.
- [x] Like / unlike a post.
- [ ] Comments.
- [ ] Tags. Clicking a tag shows all the posts with that tag.
- [ ] A search box that filters the index page by name.
- [ ] Paged display. Only show 5 posts per page.
- [ ] Upload an image to go along with a post.
- [ ] Format posts using Markdown.
- [ ] An RSS feed of new posts.
